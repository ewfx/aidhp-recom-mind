## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration behind FinSight Local stems from the need for more personalized and empathetic financial guidance. Many individuals struggle to navigate the complexities of personal finance, often receiving generic advice that doesn't account for their unique circumstances and emotional relationship with money. FinSight Local aims to bridge this gap by providing tailored support and actionable insights, empowering users to make informed financial decisions and improve their financial well-being.

## ⚙️ What It Does

FinSight Local provides the following key features:

* **Intelligent Conversational Interface:** Enables users to interact via text or voice to ask financial questions and receive personalized advice.
* **Emotional Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes user input to understand their emotional state related to finances, allowing for empathetic and supportive guidance.
* **Causal Insight Generation:** Identifies causal relationships between financial patterns, providing actionable recommendations based on the "why" behind user behavior.
* **Resource Integration:** Connects users with relevant financial resources, such as banks, credit unions, workshops, and investment opportunities.
* **Proactive Notifications:** Delivers timely and personalized financial alerts and recommendations.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login using customer ID.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

FinSight Local was built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies and robust frameworks:

* **Large Language Models:** OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural language processing and response generation.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** BERT-based models and Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis.
* **Backend and Logic:** Python with Django framework for web application development and Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning.
